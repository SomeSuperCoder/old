Tasks:
7) Fix negative number issue
10) Check transaction outputs, so they are not negative and follow token rules
13) Try except everything!
15) Make the "serialize strict" funtion work normal
18) Transaction fees... There is an idea to auto calculate them(you can borrow the io_sum code from the utils and actually make a function for that in utils)
19) Check if a mint is allowed in a transaction(search its outputs, actually make a function in utils that will sort the outputs by their TYPE AND TOKEN in to dict(I think you already wrote this code somewhere in utils))
20) What if the user enters an invalid output index in the input? Fix it!
21) Check if the transaction inputs are real
22) If the input sum-output sum is less that zero for any token is less than zero(don't forget to not count the mint and reward type tokens) consider the transaction invalid
26) Add timestamps and validate them
27) Add NFT support
28) Make the decimals actually do something
29) Zip and base64 the blockchain when saved(do this last)
30) Disallow two duplicate tokens
31) Create a "calculate reward" based on halving function
32) Disallow sending money to your self
33) Block ids must follow each other!
34) Check before sending!
35) Check and do all token stuff
36) Search for unspent outputs staring from the end

12) Create output types: send, reward, burn, commission, fee, mint, gas. Maby add Input types too?
